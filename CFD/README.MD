The Thermostatic Expansion Valve (TXV) is simulated under two-phase flow conditions in ANSYS Fluent to capture the complex interaction between liquid and vapor refrigerant. The simulation includes:

Phase change modeling: Evaporation and condensation of the refrigerant inside the TXV.

Multiphase flow: Accurate representation of liquid–vapor distribution and flow dynamics.

Heat transfer analysis: Temperature and enthalpy fields are resolved across the TXV geometry.

Boundary conditions: Inlet mass flow rate, pressure, and temperature are specified based on EV heat pump operating conditions.

These simulations provide a high-fidelity reference for validating AI/ML models and understanding TXV behavior under real operating conditions.
